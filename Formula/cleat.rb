# Homebrew formula for cleat.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SOURCE BUILD, AND NOT A BOTTLE OF THE RELEASE ARCHIVES
#
# cleat-worker requires CGO: wasmtime is the only WASM backend cleat has, and
# under CGO_ENABLED=0 engine/backend_wasmtime.go (`//go:build cgo`) is compiled
# out, NewWasmtimeBackend returns ErrWasmtimeCGOUnavailable, and the worker
# exits 1 during startup before it reads a flag.
#
# .goreleaser.yml therefore builds cleat-worker for **linux only** -- a CGO
# darwin binary cannot be linked on the ubuntu runner the release job uses
# without osxcross, and all of .github/workflows runs ubuntu. See
# IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md 3.54.
#
# So there is no macOS cleat-worker in the release archives for a formula to
# repackage. Building from source is what closes that gap: it moves the CGO
# link to the install machine, which is the one place it is free -- Homebrew
# already requires the Xcode Command Line Tools, so a C toolchain is
# guaranteed to be present.
#
# `cleat` and `cleat-gen` link neither runtime and are built CGO-free here, the
# same way the release builds them, so that what a Homebrew user gets matches
# what a tarball user gets.
#
# VERIFICATION
#
# Measured 2026-09-01 on darwin/arm64, against this exact recipe run over the
# published v0.2.0 source tarball:
#
#   CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -o out/cleat     ./cmd/cleat        -> OK
#   CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -o out/cleat-gen ./cmd/cleat-gen    -> OK
#   CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -trimpath -o out/cleat-worker ./cmd/cleat-worker -> OK
#   file out/cleat-worker      -> Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
#   ./out/cleat-worker --verify-backend
#                              -> verify-backend: OK: wasmtime backend available
#
# THIS IS A TEMPLATE, NOT AN INSTALLABLE FORMULA (cleat#2068)
#
# `url` and `sha256` below are literal placeholder tokens, not real values --
# see scripts/render-homebrew-formula.sh, which is the only thing that
# understands them. The working formula lives at
# https://github.com/cleat-team/homebrew-tap/blob/main/Formula/cleat.rb ,
# `brew install cleat-team/tap/cleat` uses it, and
# .github/workflows/release.yml's homebrew-bump job pushes a fresh render of
# THIS file there after every GitHub Release, so the two cannot drift the way
# a hand-maintained pair does. This copy stays under normal PR review because
# it is the only editable one -- the tap copy is generated, not authored.
#
# Structural changes (the install steps, the test block, comments) belong
# here. Do not hand-edit url/sha256 here for a real release -- they are
# placeholders on purpose, and the render script's own test
# (TestRenderProducesAPinnedTaggedFormula in formula_test.go) fails if they
# ever stop looking like ones.
#
# Testing a structural change before a release: `brew install --HEAD
# --build-from-source packaging/homebrew/Formula/cleat.rb.tmpl` builds from
# the `head` line below (the develop branch) and never touches url/sha256 at
# all -- see docs/project/release-process.md.
